# Advising Response Library

Centralized Excel workbook for academic advising at SLU. It includes ready to paste stock responses, a referral cheat sheet, and a decision tree to route students to the correct office or resource. This saves time, keeps tone consistent, and reduces errors.

## Contents

- **Sheet1**  
  Your base set of canned replies. Now expanded with more registration, waitlist, DegreeWorks, study abroad, transfer, withdrawal, CADR, tutoring, Career Services, and handbook responses.

- **Cheat Sheet**  
  Quick lookup table: Issue → Referral or Resource → Notes or Links. Covers Registrar, Student Financial Services, CADR, Student Success Center, Career Services, Study Abroad, Provost policies, Catalog, and program handbooks (OT, PT, AT).

- **Decision Tree**  
  Problem → Advisor Action → Referral or Resource → Notes or Links. Built for fast triage. Example nodes include registration errors, full classes, withdrawals, transfer credit, accommodations, study help, study abroad, catalog year, DegreeWorks blocks, OT or PT or AT sequencing, career planning, financial aid, and transcripts.
